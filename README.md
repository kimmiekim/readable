**Readable**
*A content and comment web app* where users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

Built on react and redux.
Currently in progress of being built, thus no instructions to download the app yet. 

In order to view, open up 2 terminal browsers. Enter the below on one of the browser to acess the backend server: 
```
git clone git@github.com:kimmiekim/readable.git
cd backend-server
node server.js
```
Then on the other browser, let's run the front end 
```
npm install
npm start
```
Thanks!
